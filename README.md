**WordView** aims to be a language learning platform mostly centered around music, you can pick up an international song you like, listen to it and the app will create a full lesson around the lyrics!

# Development
Any help is welcome, if you think you can help with something, take a look at https://github.com/orgs/word-view/projects/2

To start developing, you will need to have [APIWordView](https://github.com/word-view/APIWordView/releases/latest) running. Download the jar and execute it in the terminal:
```sh
    java -jar ./wordview-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar
```
By default, the API will use the H2 database so changes are not persistent.
